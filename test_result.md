# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false

##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Issue: PostModal component was checking for post.youtube_id field, but database has YouTube URLs in media.url field (format: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID). This caused YouTube videos to show error message instead of playing. Fix Applied: Updated PostModal.jsx to extract video ID from YouTube URL using regex pattern matching. Now supports: (1) youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID format, (2) youtu.be/VIDEO_ID format, (3) youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID format, (4) Falls back to post.youtube_id if present. Testing Results After Fix: ✅ Found 50+ YouTube posts on page, ✅ YouTube iframe loads successfully with correct embed URL (https://www.youtube.com/embed/bh9Dxx7WJvk?autoplay=1&rel=0), ✅ Video ID extracted correctly from URL (e.g., bh9Dxx7WJvk), ✅ Autoplay parameter present (autoplay=1), ✅ Related videos disabled (rel=0), ✅ Iframe has proper attributes (allow, allowFullScreen), ✅ Loading spinner appears briefly (~0.8s), ✅ Modal interactions work during playback (like, comment, share buttons functional), ✅ Stats visible, ✅ Modal closes correctly.

Investigation revealed PostCard components have fixed width 'w-[280px]' which is designed for carousel layouts but is being used in grid layout on Recommendations page. This causes cards to overflow on mobile. WORKING FEATURES: ✅ Page loads correctly, ✅ Title shows 'Trending Now' for non-logged-in users, ✅ Subtitle shows 'Popular content across all platforms', ✅ Sparkles icon visible in header, ✅ Trending Topics card visible with 5 topics, ✅ Topics display as pills with #TopicName (count) format, ✅ Topics have gradient background (red to pink), ✅ 'Most Engaging Posts' heading visible, ✅ 20 posts displayed in grid (xl:grid-cols-6), ✅ Posts are clickable, ✅ Modal opens with post details, ✅ Save/Like/Comment/Share buttons all visible and working in modal, ✅ API calls successful (/api/recommendations?limit=20, /api/trending/topics?limit=5), ✅ Navigation flow working. FIX NEEDED: PostCard component should not have fixed width when used in grid layouts. Need to make PostCard responsive or create separate component for grid layouts."

    message: "Completed testing of Sprint 2.3 & 2.4. Found and fixed 2 CRITICAL bugs: (1) Backend route order issue causing /api/posts/new-count to return 404 - FIXED by reordering routes, (2) FiltersPanel z-index stacking issue preventing modal from opening - FIXED by increasing z-index to z-20. All Sprint 2.3 & 2.4 features now working. ShareButton component functional with all share options. FiltersPanel opens correctly with all filters visible. NewPostsNotification component renders and polls correctly. Ready for comprehensive UI testing."
