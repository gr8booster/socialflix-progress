<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully built ChyllApp (originally SocialFlix) from scratch, starting with a Netflix-style frontend using mock data. Key early steps involved UI development, debugging styling issues, and establishing a full-stack architecture (React, FastAPI, MongoDB). The project evolved from mock content to integrating real viral content from 10 social media platforms (Reddit, YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, Threads, Snapchat, Pinterest, LinkedIn) using OAuth/API calls and custom scrapers. Extensive UI/UX improvements were made, including video playback, animations, hover effects, and a responsive design. An Admin panel was created for scraper management and analytics. The project roadmap was documented and committed to Git, and the next task, Sprint 1 (Google OAuth authentication), was initiated.

<product_requirements>
The initial request was to clone Netflix, but instead of movies, it should display viral content from social media apps, named SocialFlix. The user explicitly requested to:
1. Show viral content from social apps.
2. Allow users to connect, post, and interact (future feature).
3. Initially support top 6, then expanded to all 10 major social media platforms.
4. Start as a full-stack application, beginning with mock viral content and later integrating real scrapers.
5. Rebrand the application to ChyllApp.
6. Integrate specific APIs and OAuth credentials provided by the user for the social media platforms.
7. Address UI/UX issues, specifically ensuring videos play, improving interactivity, and enhancing visual differentiation between platforms.
8. Debug static UI elements and ensure correct display of stats (likes, comments).
9. Improve overall UI with animations, ripple effects, smooth transitions, and a scroll-to-top button.
10. Create a roadmap document (Sprints 1, 2, 3, 4) and commit it to Git.
11. Start working on Sprint 1: User Authentication using Google OAuth.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has just finished a major debugging and UI/UX improvement sprint for the ChyllApp. The app is a fully functional MVP, aggregating viral content from 10 major social media platforms. All 185 posts currently displayed are real, fetched from dedicated platform scrapers/APIs (Reddit, YouTube, Twitter/X, Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, Threads, Snapchat, Pinterest, LinkedIn) and stored in MongoDB.

Current state of the product:
-   **Frontend:** Displays content in a Netflix-style interface with a dynamic Hero section, platform-specific horizontal carousels, and detailed post modals.
    -   **UI/UX:** Significant improvements include:
        -   Functional video playback within modals for YouTube/TikTok content.
        -   Enhanced hover effects and animations across PostCards and carousels.
        -   Prominent play button overlays on video cards.
        -   Animated background in the Hero section and improved button animations.
        -   Ripple effects on interactive elements and smooth page transitions.
        -   Vibrant, pulse-animated platform badges.
        -   A floating Scroll to top button.
        -   Correct display of post statistics (likes, comments, shares) in modals.
-   **Backend:** Fully integrated with all 10 social media platform APIs/scrapers.
    -   **Data:** MongoDB is populated with 185 unique posts.
    -   **Admin Panel:** The  page provides an interface to trigger individual scrapers and view current post counts per platform.
-   **Rebranding:** The app has been successfully rebranded from SocialFlix to ChyllApp.

The engineer confirmed that the UI issues like static display, non-playing videos, and incorrect stat display have been addressed, and the modal is opening correctly for various post types. The project roadmap has been created and committed.
